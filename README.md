# hello-world

Hi New World of Github, 

I'm from New York, this is my time using Github for practice. 
I played soccer my whole life and still love the game but 
fell in even more love with coding. As a soon to be mechanical engineer graudaute, my 
first experience with coding was MATLAB. Now I am into IOS development and 
anything else that will help me become a better coder. Co-founder and 
soon to be known company DeCoded. BBG will become a reality.

Thank you, 
Richard Robinson
